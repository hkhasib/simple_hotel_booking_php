# simple_hotel_booking_php
PHP Hotel Booking Script

It was a very old classroom project for my database course in university. I have not published it anywhere. After a long time, I realized I should publish it on Github :)

<h2>How to Run this Project?</h2>
 It's very simple. You will just host it on localhost. Then, Visit your project from Web Browser. It will ask you to insert database details. I assume you already have created your database. Just input the database name along with the credentials.
 
 After that, It will give you options to create admin account. Just create and start using. You will understand the rest of the things.
